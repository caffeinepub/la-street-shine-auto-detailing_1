  "summary": "The diff modifies Hero.tsx, frontend-file-summaries.txt, and project_state.json. None of these files is WhyChooseUs.tsx. REQ-29 requires auditing and removing arrow/chevron/directional icons from the '5-Star Rated Service' card in WhyChooseUs.tsx, but no changes to WhyChooseUs.tsx are present in the diff. The frontend-file-summaries.txt entry for WhyChooseUs.tsx still describes it as having 'five value proposition cards (unchanged)', with no mention of arrow removal. The changes to Hero.tsx and other files are unrelated to REQ-29.",

      "reason": "WhyChooseUs.tsx is not modified in the diff at all. The file-summaries entry for WhyChooseUs.tsx describes the cards as 'unchanged' with no mention of arrow or icon removal. No evidence that any arrow or chevron was removed from the 5-Star Rated Service card.",
